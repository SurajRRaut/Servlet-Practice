# Java Servlet Practice Project

Welcome to the Java Servlet Practice Project repository! This project is designed to help you practice and enhance your skills in Java servlet development, a technology used for building dynamic web applications in Java.

## Project Overview

This practice project focuses on developing a simple web application using Java servlets, where you can learn and implement various servlet functionalities, such as handling HTTP requests, processing form data, session management, and integrating servlets with JavaServer Pages (JSP) for dynamic content generation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command :
  git clone : https://github.com/your-username/servlet-practice-project.git

2. Set up your development environment with the necessary tools, such as Java Development Kit (JDK), a servlet container like Apache Tomcat, and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans.

3. Configure your servlet container to deploy the web application. In the case of Apache Tomcat, you may need to define the application context path and configure the servlet mappings.

4. Explore the project code and directory structure to understand the different components, including servlet classes, web.xml configuration file, JSP files, and static resources.

5. Run the servlet application on your servlet container and access it in your web browser to interact with the implemented functionalities.
